What does this mod do?
This mod checks customer's VAT number regarding his country and displays VAT on invoice and packingslip as well as removes tax when shipping to companies in countries within the EU.

- Add a text field during account registration and  modification...
- Add shop VAT number on invoice and packing slip
- Add customer VAT number on invoice
- Don't add tax in checkout payment (if configured correctly) if customer has entered VAT number and is in a country within EU but is in a country other than the Store.
- Don't add tax on any prices in the store if customer is logged in with verified VAT-number and customers shipping address is not in the same country as the store.

- Control of the VAT number is done in admin (for both customers and shop number)
- Enable/disable server verification in configuration (in admin).
- Check VAT number for registering companies (not yet implemented in admin) according to their country.

Locations / Taxes-> Zone Definitions = "EU" -> Insert All Countries in EU, Except Your Country.
Locations / Taxes-> Tax Classes = Your Tax Class (ie "VAT")
Locations / Taxes-> Tax Rates = Your Tax Rate. Set Your Tax Class and Your Zone (ie "Moms", "Sweden", "25", "Moms (VAT) 25%", 1)
Locations / Taxes-> Tax Rates = Your Tax Rate. Set Your Tax Class and "EU" Zone (ie "Moms", "EU", "25", "VAT (Moms) 25%", 2)

If you want to you can have more zones for countries outside EU. Just create the Zone Definitions you need and assign tax to the zones in Tax Rates. In order for the prices to show with the correct tax, set priority as follows: EU 1, Sweden 2 and World 3. If you don't get it right, laborate with the priorities.
